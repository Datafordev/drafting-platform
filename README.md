# Policy Drafting Platform
**A drafting environment based on Etherpad built for and with legislative policy drafters**

[demo](http://drafting-demo.opengovfoundation.org)

[TL;DR skip to plugins and installation]()

## What are we trying to solve?

The status of policy document editing on the web today only focuses on aesthetics - bold, underline, italics, etc.  This is a very shallow representation of more complex documents such as legal codes or policy documents.  The markings on these documents have meaning, and the meaning is much more important than the font weight.  The web and semantic markup gives us the ability to capture this meaning behind the scenes while keeping the drafting process simple for the author.

## What are we building?

Authors will be able to draft in an environment that feels like what theyâ€™re used to - word processors such as MS Word.  The platform, however, will have an understanding of the document context.  The editor will understand citations to legal codes, amendments, and other domain-specific elements and simplify connecting inter-related documents.  It will also provide the final product in a multitude of formats including Word documents, PDFs, HTML, and even XML.

## How are we building it?

We're developing a number of plugins for [Etherpad](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite) to customize the tool to be tailored for policy drafting.  The plugins and installation guide are listed below.
